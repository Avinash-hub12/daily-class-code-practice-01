        Paradise Island is an island in the Bahamas formerly known as Hog Island.
        The island, with an area of 277 hectares (685 acres)[1] (2.8 km2/1.1 sq mi), 
        is just off the shore of the city of Nassau, which is itself on the northern edge of the island of New Providence.
        It is best known for the sprawling resort Atlantis,
        with its extensive water park rides, pools, beach, restaurants,
        walk-in aquarium, and casinos.[2][3][4]
        Paradise Island is connected to New Providence by two bridges
        that cross Nassau Harbour. 
        The first was built in 1966 by Resorts International, and the second in the late 1990s.

        Huntington Hartford, the A&P supermarket heir,
        arrived on Hog Island in 1959. Hartford bought Hog Island from 
        Axel Wenner-Gren[5] in 1960-1961 and changed the name to 
        Paradise Island in 1962. He hired the Palm Beach architect 
        John Volk and built the Ocean Club, Cafe Martinique, Hurricane Hole, 
        and the Golf Course, among other island landmarks. He also acquired and
        installed the Cloisters, a 14th-century French Augustinian 
        monastery originally purchased in Montréjeau[6]
        and dismantled by William Randolph Hearst in 
        the 1920s. He hired Gary Player to be the golf 
        pro and Pancho Gonzales to be the tennis pro.

        <b>Paradise Island Airport</b>
        There was a small airstrip on the island from 1989 to 1999 
        to serve the resort. Before 1989 the airport was a seaplane
        base with a ramp for aircraft to leave the water. 
        In 1989 a 910-metre (3,000 ft) runway was added to the 
        airport.[7] The airport's codes were PID (IATA) 
        and MYPI (ICAO). Paradise Island Airlines and Chalk's 
        International Airlines were the airport's main tenants.
        US Airways Express also served the airport from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood 
        International Airport.

        Development as a gambling resort
        Hartford met James M. Crosby through Hartford's bodyguard 
        Sy Alter. Alter met Crosby at the Colony Club in Palm Beach. 
        Hartford obtained a gambling licence for Paradise Island
        and included Crosby as an extra investor. 
        Crosby and Jack Davis then formed a company,
        Resorts International, to continue developing 
        the island.[8][9]
